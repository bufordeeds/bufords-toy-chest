# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Documentation

## Current Status: Planning Phase

A comprehensive implementation plan for adding Tic-Tac-Toe to the toy chest application.

## Implementation Plan

### Architecture Overview

Following the existing patterns from the 2048 game, the implementation will use:

-   **BaseGame class** (`gameFramework.ts:61-129`) - Core framework
-   **Game-specific logic** - Extends BaseGame for Tic-Tac-Toe mechanics
-   **React component** - UI wrapper with event handling
-   **CSS animations** - Board interactions and game state feedback
-   **Zustand store** - State persistence and leaderboard integration

### File Structure

```
frontend/src/games/tic-tac-toe/
TicTacToe.ts              # Core game logic
TicTacToeComponent.tsx    # React component
TicTacToeComponent.css    # Styling and animations
types.ts                  # TypeScript interfaces
```

### Core Features

#### Game Logic (`TicTacToe.ts`)

-   **Player Management**: X and O alternating turns
-   **Board State**: 3x3 grid with win detection
-   **Move Validation**: Prevent invalid moves
-   **Game End Detection**: Win/draw conditions
-   **Undo System**: Limited undos per game
-   **Score Tracking**: Wins/losses/draws statistics

#### UI Component (`TicTacToeComponent.tsx`)

-   **Interactive Grid**: Click-to-play board
-   **Player Indicators**: Current player display
-   **Game Status**: Win/draw/turn announcements
-   **Control Buttons**: New game, undo, reset
-   **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop support

#### Styling (`TicTacToeComponent.css`)

-   **Toy Chest Theme**: Matches existing design system
-   **Grid Animations**: Hover effects and tile placements
-   **Winning Animations**: Highlight winning combinations
-   **Player Colors**: Distinct X/O visual styling

### Integration Points

#### Routing Integration (`data/games.ts:23-32`)

Already configured as multiplayer game with:

-   Game ID: `tic-tac-toe`
-   Name: "Tic-Tac-Toe Plus"
-   Type: `multiplayer` (2 players)
-   Difficulty: `easy`

#### Component Registration (`GamePage.tsx`)

Will require dynamic import for the TicTacToe component

#### Leaderboard System

-   **Win/Loss Ratios**: Track player performance
-   **Game Statistics**: Total games, win streaks
-   **Player Names**: Optional multiplayer identification

### Development Phases

1. **Core Logic** - Extend BaseGame with Tic-Tac-Toe mechanics
2. **Basic UI** - Clickable 3x3 grid with game state
3. **Styling** - Visual polish matching toy chest theme
4. **Animations** - Smooth interactions and feedback
5. **Integration** - Connect to routing and store systems
6. **Testing** - Validate game logic and UI interactions
7. **Documentation** - Complete implementation details

### Technical Specifications

#### State Management

Following `Game2048State` pattern with:

```typescript
interface TicTacToeState {
	board: ('X' | 'O' | null)[][];
	currentPlayer: 'X' | 'O';
	gameStatus: 'playing' | 'won' | 'draw';
	winner: 'X' | 'O' | null;
	winningLine: number[] | null;
	moveHistory: Move[];
	scores: PlayerScores;
}
```

#### Input Handling

-   Cell click events with validation
-   Keyboard navigation support
-   Touch-friendly mobile interactions

#### Animation System

-   CSS transitions for tile placement
-   Winning line highlight animations
-   Game state transition effects

#### Performance Considerations

-   Lightweight implementation for quick games
-   Minimal re-renders with proper state management
-   Efficient win detection algorithms

### Game Rules Implementation

#### Standard Tic-Tac-Toe

-   3x3 grid
-   Players alternate placing X and O
-   Win by getting 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
-   Draw when board is full with no winner

#### Future Enhancements

-   **Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe**: 9 sub-grids variant
-   **AI Opponent**: Single-player mode with difficulty levels
-   **Custom Board Sizes**: 4x4, 5x5 variations
-   **Time Limits**: Blitz mode for quick games

### Quality Standards

#### Code Quality

-   **TypeScript**: Full type safety
-   **Error Handling**: Comprehensive input validation
-   **Performance**: Optimized state updates
-   **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
-   **Mobile Support**: Touch controls and responsive design

#### Testing Strategy

-   **Unit Tests**: Game logic validation
-   **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
-   **Manual Testing**: Cross-device gameplay verification
-   **Edge Cases**: Invalid moves, rapid clicking, state corruption

## Next Steps

1. Implement core TicTacToe class extending BaseGame
2. Create React component with basic grid functionality
3. Add styling and animations
4. Integrate with routing system
5. Add leaderboard and statistics tracking
6. Comprehensive testing and polish
